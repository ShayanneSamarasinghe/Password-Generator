# Password-Generator


## Usage 

This application can be used to generate random secure passwords. Using a series of user prompts we can determine if the user wants uppercase alphabetical characters, lowercase alphabetical characters, symbol character and or number characters. One wanted characters are selected the user is prompted to input a password length they want (anything between 8 and 128 characters is acceptable).Then the password generator displays a secure password, based on users criteria, in the text field on the webpage.
